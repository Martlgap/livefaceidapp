# Live Face Recognition App
This is a Streamlit App that allows you to recognize faces in a live webcam video stream. Check out the app on the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/jrieke/identity-streamlit/main/app.py) by clicking on the badge below:

# üöÄ Usage
## Run the App on Streamlit Community Cloud
You can run my app in your Browser using the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) by clicking on the badge below:

[![Open in Streamlit Community](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/jrieke/identity-streamlit/main/app.py)


## Locally on your machine (Tested on MacOS, Linux)
You can run the app locally on your machine by cloning this repository and running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Martlgap/livefaceidapp.git
cd livefaceidapp
pip -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```


## Locally on server (Tested on Linux)
If you want to run the app on a server in your local network and would like to access it from another machine in the same network, you can use the [ssl-proxy](https://github.com/suyashkumar/ssl-proxy) plugin of [suyashkumar](https://github.com/suyashkumar):

```bash
wget https://github.com/suyashkumar/ssl-proxy/releases/download/v0.2.7/ssl-proxy-linux-amd64.tar.gz

gzip -d ssl-proxy-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf ssl-proxy-linux-amd64.tar

./ssl-proxy-linux-amd64 -from 0.0.0.0:8502 -to 0.0.0.0:8501
```
After that you are able to access the app in your browser via https://your-server-ip:8502

# üß† Machine Learning Models
The app uses the following machine learning models:
- Face Detection: FaceMesh ([MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html))
- Face Recognition: [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381) Architecture, trained with [MS1M](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08221) dataset and [ArcFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698) Loss using [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org), converted to [ONNX](https://onnxruntime.ai)


# üìñ About
I developed this app during a project at the [Chair of Human-Machine Communication](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/mmk/home/). The goal was to compare live face recognition systems across different platforms.

# ü™≤ BUGS - KNOWN ISSUES - TODOS:
- [ ] Running the app on streamlit community cloud introduces a severe lag/delay in the video stream. This is also present when working with the app locally on a server. There should be a way to reduce the delay, either by setting the buffer size smaller or by using frame dropping.
